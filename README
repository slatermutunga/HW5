I removed the Back to Home button from each page, and switched it with links to each individual page, to make site traversal easier. I changed the footer to be more personalized, 
and corrected the year. I changed the Merch page, to a Donation page. I removed the unnecessary links, the Reddit link on the Links page, and the Amazon link on the Donation page.
I also changed the CSS to make links pop out more.
